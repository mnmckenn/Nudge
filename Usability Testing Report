## Feedback to Nudge
B14 PicFix - Feedback to Nudge

The first feedback that we received from PicFix (Team B14) was about our profile creation process. They believed that we maybe should not have a next button on top, but have a swipe feature on our application for the user to be able to go forward and back on the categories portion of the creation process. That, or to compliment the two with each other to add a better user experience when creating their profile. Second, they believed that categories should be able to have an “I don’t remember” option when deciding whether or not you have already done one of the nudges in your past during the profile creation process, and when expanding on your profile.

To resolve these issues, we are going to first take a look back at the creation process and determine what will easier for the user to be able to fill out our questions during the creation process (most likely have the option to both swipe to the next section or press an arrow button to go forward or back). For the “I don’t remember” option, we are going to add a third option so that it isn’t just a “yes” or “no” when creating the profile to solve this issue.

For the layout of our application, they first thought the background that we were using made it difficult to be able to read the text. They also thought that the “home” screen once logged into the application should not show all of the nudge categories, but should only show the categories that are chosen / have the categories with active nudges first. This layout would have the home page be “favorites,” then the next page over would have all the categories, then it would continue on to information on the profile. Finally, they thought the “random” category should be changed to “important.” This is because that category would be what we have determined would be the important nudges that the user should be accomplishing at that time, instead of just sending them off on a totally random nudge that might not be very important in helping them becoming a better adult at that time. 

For these issues, we are already planning on switching our background / text combination to make our application easier to read for our users. We will also be following the advice that we received on have the nudge categories that are applicable to the user on the first home screen, then having all of the categories and the ability for the user to expand their profile on the next tab over. Finally, we will also be implementing their final advice in changing the “random” category to being something similar to “important” so that our users will be getting nudges that will be the best to help guide them in becoming better adults.
