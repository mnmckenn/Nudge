# Production Report #1##Project Summary**Nudge**, is a personal assistant app that helps make adulting easier by having a pre-populated list of reminders and curriculum curated to your lifestyle. Own a car? Get yearly reminders to change your oil. Want to save money in an adult way? Get reminders to contribute to savings/retirement account. Are you overwhelmed with what it means to be an adult? Don’t worry Nudge has your back and can provide information and service suggestions to get you started.##Nudge Problem Space ResearchThere are over 75.4 million Millennials in America. As millennials navigate the transition to adulthood Nudge is there to help them with adulting. Adulting is:>1. to behave in an adult manner; engage in activities associated with adulthood2. to make someone behave like an adult; turn someone into an adult”. Adulting is also a new and popular phenomenon (see graphic).![alttext](/Users/Chancellor/GitHub/Nudge/img/adulting.png)Several self-help books, courses, and services have sprung up around the theme of teaching one how to adult. However, there is no simple app to help one with the tasks and help young-adults with their individual needs. This is where nudge comes in to help the user with guides and action plans for a handful of adulting specific tasks personalized for the user.Nudge’s objective is simple: help millennials with adulting. Nudge’s focus will be to hone-in a few major key challenges millennials face and make them painless. This process will be delightful and painless way.Based on current research on what young-adults struggle the most with there are three-main themes: financial management, health care management, and general self-help.##Platform and Technical Information####InfrastructureThis week we configured the infrastructure for our application and database. The follow items have been implemented:- AWS EC2 Instance running Amazon Linux.- MongoDB installed on instance.- S3 instance as backup storage.- Security settings have been configured so we don't accidently bill the primary account. - Email mnmckenn@uw.edu for credentials.References: - [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)- [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)- [Amazon EC2 + MongoDB interaction](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/platforms/amazon-ec2/)####DatabaseAfter considering three database options. We decided to implement MongoDB for our backend solution.#####Benefits include:- NonSqL- Uses JSON datatypes- Scalable- Encrypted transmission and storageMore information can be found on [MongoDB] (https://www.mongodb.com/manual)'s website.Steps for create MongoDB on AWS ([link](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/mongodb-on-the-aws-cloud-new-quick-start-reference-deployment/)).###Nudge ObjectsThe objects that we will be using for our application will be created with JSON and stored on Mongo, all being hosted on Amazon Web Services. Each object will consist of the main parent category (such as finances, medical, work, etc.) that will then be broken down into subcategories, including the tasks involved with that parent category. Below is an example of what the template for what our objects may look like:	- Parent Category:		- Description			- Show more    - Tasks      - Description (toggle)			- Show more			- Reminder			- Suggestions (toggle)			- Notes			- (HIDDEN)				- TAGS		- ...			- ...		- Crowd Suggested tasks    -  Create own taskThis specific design will be adjusted down the road to accommodate the new curriculum them.###PrototypingThis week we did not update our prototype. Instead we discussed, under the suggestion of our lectures, to think about create more of a curriculum theme rather than reminders. This revamp in design is not yet fleshed out enough to prototype.- [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)####DevelopmentIn this sprint, the development team installed and configured the ionic framework. - [Ionic (mobile app framework)](https://ionicframework.com/)##GitHub RepositoryOur live github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mnmckenn/Nudge).##Table of FunctionalityWe are using Wafflo.io to track our project backlog. The tiles seen in the screen cap below correspond to our github [issues](https://github.com/mnmckenn/Nudge/issues). Our team is using the agile development process, so each tile corresponds to a functionality task to be implement during a sprint cycle. A recurring task for the Project Manager is to make sure that any additionally functionality requests are added to backlog.Below is a screenshot as of the time of this assignment submission.![](/Users/Chancellor/GitHub/Nudge/img/Wafflo_screencap_a1.png)Real-time functionality tracking can be found either on [Github](https://github.com/mnmckenn/Nudge/issues) or on [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/mnmckenn/Nudge)##Next StepsNext week we will be focusing on:- Designing Nudge Object curriculum- Confirming Ionic + server interaction- Updating prototype- Add a test user to the database- Develop individual nudge object screenAdditionally, Iman will hone out exactly what tasks in those 3-problem spaces are the best fit for the app nudge. There will be 3-5 specific tasks that the app can do that'll help the user with adulting
