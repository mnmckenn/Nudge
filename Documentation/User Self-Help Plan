# User Self-Help Plan

Random (Challenge??) Nudges
	• These are nudges that will pushed forward to the user that we have deemed are either important for that time or randomly selected if there are no current important nudges
	• Extra points for completing random nudges in a set amount of time
		○ In order to try to push our users to becoming better adults, we will be giving extra points for completing these "challenge" nudges. This will incentivize our users to completing these actions in a timely matter (within in a week of the nudge being pushed to our user). 
	• Log-in / Notification sent to user about "New Challenge Nudge"
		○ Every week, the user will be notified that they have received a new "challenge" nudge. Then, once logged into the application, a pop up will appear with details of the challenge nudge that they have received, and the amount of bounty that they will receive for completing it.  
	• Non-completed challenge nudge
		○ A challenge nudge that is not completed will be added back into the normal nudges.
	• New Challenge Nudge
		○ After a week a new challenge nudge will be selected. If the previous challenge nudge was not completed in the allotted time, then it will be removed from being a challenge nudge and changed into a normal nudge. Then the new challenge nudge will be made and a notification will be pushed to the user

Important Nudges - New nudges chosen 
	• These are the nudges that will be important for the user to complete in the near future. This means that these nudges have some sort of time deadline that is coming up, so the user must act upon these nudges in the near future. This could be something like completing your taxes, winter proofing your house because it is about to be winter, or checking emergency supplies because stormy weather is predicted in the future.
