# Mentoring Session #1 Feedback Notes:

Each team is required to have 2 mentoring sessions in the Spring quarter.
Provide a one-page summary of the discussion your team had with the mentor. The report should include:
	• Mentor name: Nam-ho Park
	• Summary of presentation to mentor
	• Key issues raised
	• You team's response to issues
	• Next steps

Questions:
	• Suggestions on presenting curriculum to our target demographic (young adults struggle with stress of finance, medical stuff, and general such as self help)
		○ Note: Medical, include travel for shots and stuff (I made that mistake)
	• Granularity of our content
		○ Focus on the audience. Having enough content that adds value, but not too much
		○ Make it fun. Find a way to make things fun. "Scheduled your first dentist appointment, high five!!"
			§ Uber has a map, makes it fun, shows you what the driver is doing. Creates a fun experience with the application and keeps your eyes glued to the app
		○ Make it easy. But fun will make it stick with people
Feedback:
	• Doing taxes for the first time (but this was before tax software. Now TurboTax has it covered?? But maybe room for adding stuff)
		○ TurboTax could be a sponsor for advertising
	• What he likes:
		○ There are pivotal moments in people's lives where they are marketable. 
			§ Target is an example of this. Pregnancy is when the key moments where someone will switch brands. So Target marketed to a woman and knew she was pregnant before she did
		○ When there are a lot of things that are changing in your life and a product changes you and touches you, you will be committed to that product
		○ Find the pain points in people's lives and then you can take advantage of that
	• Challenges:
		○ Deliver the content in the way that is useful and valid
	• Gameify the application
		○ Have levels. Accomplishing the basics, then moving on from there. Lowest level should be achievable by anybody. The highest should be something really good, like having a tax consultant because you've been so successful
